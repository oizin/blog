    "description": "Structural nested mean models are an important method for causal inference in settings with time-varyings treatments.\nThey model the difference between two treatment regimes and naturally incorporate effect modification, making them a \nuseful option in studies investigating personalised approaches to medical treatment.\nIn this post, we'll introduce the basics of structural nested mean models, and the associated method of G-estimation \nin a single decision setting.",
